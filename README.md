# Deques-and-Randomized-Queus
The purpose of this project is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked list.
This project is realted to my Algorithms and Data Structures Course at UMB. 
This project has several short exercises - BinaryStrings, Primes, MinMax, Buffer and Josephus. 
While it has some problems as well - LinkedDeque, Sort, ResizingArrayRandomQeueu, and Sample. 
I have attached the report whihc in detail explains what the problems does. 
This assignment is adapted from the Princeton Creative assignment website.
